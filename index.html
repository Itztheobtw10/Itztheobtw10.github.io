        <h2>About <span>Me</span></h2>
        <p>Hi! I'm Theo, an A-Level Computer Science student with a strong passion for the world of technology and programming. From a young age, I've been drawn to creating and exploring—whether it was figuring out how to fix the internet, experimenting with mini games on Scratch, or diving into new coding concepts. My journey in computer science has only deepened my curiosity and drive to learn more.

            I'm eager to expand my programming skills, particularly in Python, and I'm also keen to grow in web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through continuous learning and hands-on projects, I’m excited to push my knowledge forward and build a solid foundation for a future in software development and tech innovation.</p>

            <h3>Mini Robot Coffee Barista</h3>
            <p>As a young developer, I designed a miniature robotic barista that engages
                customers in a friendly and personalized manner. Upon customer entry, the
                robot initiates a conversation by asking how they are, followed by requesting
                their name to be placed on their coffee cup. The barista then displays the menu
                on its interface, allowing the customer to make their order selection.
                To streamline the ordering process, I created a numbered menu with
                corresponding prices. Once the customer has finalized their order, the barista
                calculates the total order cost and presents the customer with a tipping option.</p>

            <h3>BMI Calculator</h3>
            <p>I built a BMI calculator using Python that takes a patient's height and weight measurements to calculate their BMI.
                 Based on specific parameters, it provides personalized advice to support their health, including tailored diet suggestions, links to strength training resources, and recommended YouTube videos for extra guidance.
                  This project was designed to make health improvement more accessible and targeted.
